    <p>Through a 6.3-inch phone screen, I taught myself how to move my body like the great dancers I saw on a much
        larger 45.2-inch screen. From those humble beginnings, I have gone on to teach numerous people and perform
        in
        front of thousands. Dancing continues to be my intimate expression of the world around me.</p>
